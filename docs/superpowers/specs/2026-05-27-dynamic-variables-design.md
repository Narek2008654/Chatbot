# Dynamic Variables + Reusable Agents — Design

Date: 2026-05-27
Status: Approved

## Goal

Make created agents reusable across positions and people via Retell dynamic
variables, and have the agent walk into each call already knowing who it's
calling. Adapt the agent-creation flow to author long, variable-rich prompts.

## Mechanism

Retell `create-phone-call` accepts `retell_llm_dynamic_variables` (string→string)
that fill `{{placeholder}}` tokens in the agent's prompt at call time. Standard
variables: `{{caller_name}}`, `{{caller_context}}`, `{{position}}`,
`{{position_details}}`.

## Data

`Person` gains `name String?` and `background String @default("")` (operator's
"what we know" seed). It keeps the rolling `summary`. Still keyed by email.
Hand-authored migration (pgvector-safe).

## Tools

- **`lookup_person(email)`** — returns the stored `{ name, background, summary }`
  or "first interaction." Lets the model decide whether to ask the operator.
- **`place_phone_call`** gains `position`, `position_details`, `caller_name`,
  `caller_background`, `caller_context`. It sends `caller_name`/`caller_context`/
  `position`/`position_details` as `retell_llm_dynamic_variables`, and carries
  `email`/`name`/`background` in `metadata` so the webhook persists them.

## Place-a-call flow (prompt)

1. Get destination number (E.164) and the callee's email.
2. `lookup_person(email)`: first interaction → ask the operator for the person's
   name + what we know (background); returning → reuse stored name/background +
   rolling summary.
3. Pick the agent via `list_agents`; for interviews ask the **position + job
   details**.
4. Compose `caller_context` (background + summary) and call `place_phone_call`.

## Agent-creation flow (prompt, adapted)

Interview the operator about: interaction type (interview / screening / survey /
sales / support / other), main goal, question style (general vs specific) and the
actual questions/topics, persona/tone, voice, name, greeting. Then author a long,
complete prompt that **bakes in the placeholders** above with **fallback wording**
when a variable is empty. Review-before-create stays.

## Plumbing

Tool dependencies bundle into `ToolDeps { retell, chatId?, lookupPerson? }` passed
to `chat` → `runToolCall`. The stream route supplies `chatId` + a DB-backed
`lookupPerson` (scoped to the Clerk user); the AI client supplies `retell`. Keeps
the AI client free of DB access. The `call_ended` webhook persists `name`/
`background` from metadata onto the `Person` (filling only when empty).

## UI

`GET /api/calls/:id` includes the person's `name`; the engagement view shows it.

## Non-goals

No arbitrary user-defined variable names (fixed standard set); no per-agent
variable introspection; exact-email identity unchanged.
